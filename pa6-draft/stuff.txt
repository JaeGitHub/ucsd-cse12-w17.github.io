### Going from text files to tree


`generateDatabase` consumes a
[`Path`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Path.html)
and produces a mapping from _years_ to maps from _n-grams_ to _counts_. This
makes it so for each year, we can easily look up the count of an n-gram in
that year.

There are several steps you might take here, though the design is entirely up
to you. We outline several useful APIs for you to look up, and some useful
strategies to follow.

- You will need to be able to get a list of files contained in a directory
given by a `Path`. The method `Files.newDirectoryStream` can give back an
iterator over Paths, like so:

		DirectoryStream<Path> d = Files.newDirectoryStream(path, "*.{txt}");
		for(Path p: d) {
			System.out.println("This is one of the paths in this directory: " + p);
		}

- You will need to be able to get the contents of a file from its path. The
method `Files.readAllLines` is helpful here; it takes an input file and
returns it as a `List` of strings.

- You will need to decide on how to filter out punctuation and characters
like `@` from the data in the files.
